'l'he copyriqht law of the united states (Title 17, United
States Code) governs the making of the photocopies or
other reproductions of copyriqhted material including
foreign works under certain conditions. ln addition, tne

united States extends protection to foreign works by
means of various international conventions, bilateral
aqreernenm, and proclamations.

Under certain conditions specified in the law, libraries
and archives are authorized to furnish a photocopy or
other reproduction. One of these specified conditions is
that the photocopy or reproduction is not to be “used
for any purpose other than private study, scholarship‚ or
researcn.” lf a user makes a request for purposes in
excess of “fair use‚” that use may be liable for copyriqnt

infrinqement.

Tne institution reserves the right to refuse to accept a
copy order if, in its judqrnent, fulfillment of the order
would involve violation of the copyriqnt law.
